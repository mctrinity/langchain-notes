# "Enraptured Souls: A Modern Sonnet of Love and Sacrifice"


In this world of ever-changing tides,
Where love is scarce and selfishness abounds,
Two hearts collided, fate did provide,
Their love, a fire that forever resounds.

With each passing day, their bond grew strong,
A love that knew no boundaries or fear,
But sacrifices had to be made along,
For their love to thrive, they had to adhere.

Through trials and tribulations, they stood,
Together, hand in hand, through every storm,
Their love, a beacon, a flame that withstood,
The toughest of challenges, in any form.

For true love knows no limits or bounds,
And in their sacrifices, true love resounds.
