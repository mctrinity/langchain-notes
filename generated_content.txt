# generate a contemporary sonnet about love and sacrifice

Love, a force that knows no bounds,
A flame that burns, never to extinguish.
It knows no rules, it knows no grounds,
Its power, forever to distinguish.

But with love, comes a heavy price,
A sacrifice, one must be willing to make.
For this emotion, so pure and precise,
Can also bring heartache and heartbreak.

To love is to give, without hesitation,
To put another's needs before your own.
To stand by them, through any situation,
Even when the path ahead is unknown.

For love and sacrifice go hand in hand,
A bond that transcends, forever to stand.
