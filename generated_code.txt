  return '''Love and sacrifice, two forces intertwined
With every breath, our hearts they do besiege
For one without the other, love confined
And sacrifice without love, a loveless siege

For love, we give up all we hold so dear
Our time, our pride, our selfishness we shed
To see our loved one's smile, to wipe their tear
We sacrifice it all, without a second dread

But oh, how love and sacrifice they do blend
For in the giving, love does only grow
And in the sacrifice, love does transcend
To heights unknown, where only true love flows

So let us embrace these two, hand in hand
For love and sacrifice, they make us grand'''
