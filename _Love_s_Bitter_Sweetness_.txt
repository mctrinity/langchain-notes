# "Love's Bitter Sweetness"


A love once pure, now
Tainted with bitterness, its
Sweetness fading fast.

Tenderness replaced
By harsh words and icy stares,
Hearts now cold and numb.

Memories of love
Haunt, yet bitterness lingers,
A bitter aftertaste.

But still, deep within,
A glimmer of love remains,
Fighting against pain.

For in love's cycle,
Bitterness must make way for
New beginnings, new love.
